[Verse:Michelle]
I'm not worried ‘bout a thing
Cause I know you are guiding me
Where you lead me, Lord I will go
I have no fear cause I know who’s in control
There’s no limit to what you can do
Cause it all belongs to you, yes it all belongs to you
You’re almighty and all powerful
And it all belongs to you, yes it all belongs to you
[/Verse]
